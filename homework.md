# Linus's Homework

## 1. What is 2 + 2?

4

## 2. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programming language that makes websites come alive. It’s what lets web pages react when you click buttons, type in forms, or see things update without reloading the page.

## 3. What three problems does Git & GitHub solve?

They keep track of every change you make to your code.

They let multiple people work on the same project without messing each other up.

They store your code online so you can share it and back it up safely.

## 4. What happens when you `fork` a repository?

When you fork a repo, you make your own copy of someone else’s project on your GitHub account. You can play around with it or make changes without affecting the original.

## 5. What happens when you clone a repository?

Cloning a repo means downloading a copy of it from GitHub to your own computer so you can work on it locally, even without the internet.

## 6. What is a Pull Request?

A pull request is when you ask the original project to accept the changes you made. It’s like saying, “Hey, I fixed or added something—can you review it and maybe add it to the main project?”
